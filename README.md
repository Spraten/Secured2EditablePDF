The "Secured2EditablePDF" project is an advanced Python script designed to unlock password-protected PDF files, perform find-replace operations, convert them into editable DOCX and plain text files, and finally organize the output into separate directories. 

## Prerequisites
- Python (version X.X.X)
- Pip (Python package manager)
